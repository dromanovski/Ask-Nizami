# Ask-Nizami
This is a final project for Standfords' Code in Place course 
It's a an extended version of the Magic Eight Ball 
that makes predictions of your future using Persian poetry. 
The answers are random and based on “The Treasury of Mysteries”: 
a 2,500 lines long narrative poem written in the 12th century by Nizami Ganjvi 
The esoteric and philosophic nature of his poetry gives a huge space for interpretation. 
To amplify this effect I’ve also added a library of 500 random images to create additional associations.
